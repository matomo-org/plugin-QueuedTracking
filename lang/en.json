For example to configure two servers “127.0.0.1:26379” and “127.0.0.2:26879” specify “127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2” as host and “26379,26879” as ports.",

Best practice is to set the number of CPUs you want to make available for queue processing. Be aware you need to make sure to start the workers manually. We recommend to not use 9-15 workers, rather use 8 or 16 as the queue might not be distributed evenly into different queues.",
